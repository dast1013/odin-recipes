    <h1 class="recipeh1">Savory Lemon Garlic Chicken</h1> <!--Recipe title, followed be description.-->
    <p>This is a recipe my wife based on some long lost pinterest recipe.
        I have been working to cook more consistently for my wife's sanity so this is their take that I have learned.
    </p>
    <p>It seems like magic whenever I see my wife make a sauce from the fond of a pan, and it definitely felt that way when I finally understood how to make that process happen.</p>
